# KNIFE ALERT SYSTEM
The Knife Alert System is designed to harness the power of video analytics to predict knife attacks in secured spaces. It integrates advanced object detection and posture recognition technologies to facilitate early threat detection and prompt response.

## Features 
- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLO v8 model for real-time detection of knives.
- **Posture Recognition:** Implements CNNs to analyze body language and movements for potential threat identification.
- **Alarm System:** Integrates object detection and posture recognition to trigger an audible alarm upon detecting a knife and threatening posture.

## Use Cases  
- **Early Threat Detection:** Enables early identification of potential knife-related threats.
- **Enhanced Public Safety:** Contributes to the safety of individuals in public spaces by alerting security personnel in real-time.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation:** Reduces the need for constant manual monitoring, allowing security personnel to focus on critical tasks.

## Technology Used 
- YOLO v8
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Python (PyAudio, sounddevice, playsound)
